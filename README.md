# Advent Of Code 2023 (AOC2023) - Rust


This repository contains my solutions for Advent of Code 2023, written in Rust. I am using this as an opportunity to learn Rust and improve my programming skills.

## Advent Of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is an annual coding event that takes place in December. It consists of a series of programming puzzles that are released daily. Participants solve these puzzles using the programming language of their choice.

## Project Structure

- Each day's solution is organized into a separate Rust module (e.g., `day_01_01`, `day_02_01`, etc.).
- Each folder contains a file called input.txt.

## Usage

To run a specific day's solution, navigate to the corresponding directory and use the following command

```bash
cargo run
```
